        <h3>Origin of yoga</h3>
        <p>Yoga is a practice that involves the physical, mental and spiritual self. It was a discipline that originated in ancient India and was aimed at instilling peace of mind and body with concentration, meditation, postures and breathing. Yoga can be said to have over 5000 years of history and is probably one of the oldest ways to keep track of your mind and body.

        <h3>Yoga or Fitness Workout</h3>
        <p>It is often difficult to choose between yoga and fitness workouts since both have their own benefits. Yoga is mainly reserved for people who would like to take some time off their busy lives and enjoy the quiet. Meditation and monitored breathing exercises are a major part. Loss of body weight is possible with yoga, but yoga is not the right choice for someone who wants to witness quick results.

            Fitness workouts happen to show quick results if it is done regularly. Fitness workouts include intensive bodily movements like cardio workouts, skipping, jumping jacks, push-ups, pull-ups, squats and so on. Working out with weights has proven to be very effective, but for those who do not have the stamina and have some medical complications, this is not advisable.</p>
