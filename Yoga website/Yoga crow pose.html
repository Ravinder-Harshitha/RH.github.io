    <h2>How to do</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bend your knees slightly so that you can bring your palms flat on the floor, about shoulder distance apart.</li>
        <li>Plant your palms firmly on the mat about a foot in front of your feet. Spread your fingers wide and press into the top joint of each finger.</li>
        <li>Bend your elbows straight back. Don't bend them into full Chaturanga arms, but head in that direction.</li>
        <li>Come up onto the balls of your feet and open your knees so that they line up with your upper arms.</li>
        <li>Place your knees on the backs of your upper arms.</li>
        <li>Begin to bring your weight forward into your hands, lifting your head as you go.</li>
        <li>Come up onto your tiptoes, lifting one foot and then the other off the floor.</li>
        <li>Engage the inner thighs for support while keeping the knees on the arms.</li>
        <li>Hug your feet toward your butt.</li>
        <li>Focus on the feeling of the body lifting. Avoid sinking into the pose, which can dump weight into the shoulders.</li>
        <li>To come out, exhale and transfer your weight back until your feet come back to the floor.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Benifits of this pose</h2>
