    <h2>How to do</h2>
    <p>Sit cross-legged on a yoga mat with your hands on your knees, palms up. Keep your spine as straight as you can. Push the bones you're sitting on down into the floor â€” your "sit bones" in yoga-speak. Close your eyes and inhale.</p>
    <h2>Benifits of this pose</h2>
    <p>This pose also boosts back flexibility and can help relieve stress.</p>
