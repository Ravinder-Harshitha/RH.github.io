    <h2>How to do</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start from all fours in a tabletop position. Your knees under your hips and wrists under your shoulders or slightly forwards of them.</li>
        <li>Spread your fingers, root down through the base of the fingers and press your fingers on the mat.</li>
        <li>On an inhalation, lower the belly, lift your chest, tailbone pointing up and look up.</li>
        <li>Exhale, come back into your neutral ‘tabletop’ position.</li>
    </ol>
        <h2>Benifits of this pose</h2>    
    <p>Cow pose helps relieve tension in your upper body, especially in your back, shoulders, and neck, and it gently massages the spine to increase mobility. This simple pose allows for a strong front-body stretch, from chin to pubic bone.</p>
