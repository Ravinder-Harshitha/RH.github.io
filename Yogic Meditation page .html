        <h3>Guided Meditation</h3>
        <p>In guided meditation, a teacher guides you through the basic steps of the practice, either in person or via a meditation app like Headspace. This type of meditation is particularly useful for beginners because the teacher is experienced and trusted, and their guidance can be key to helping those who are new to the practice get the most out of the experience. Most guided meditations follow a similar format: the teacher explains how the mind behaves during meditation, leads you through a particular meditation technique, and then suggests how to integrate this technique into your everyday life.</p>

        <p>This meditation exercise is an excellent introduction to meditation techniques.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sit or lie comfortably. You may even want to invest in a meditation chair or cushion.</li>
            <li>Close your eyes. We recommend using one of our Cooling Eye Masks or Restorative Eye Pillows if lying down.</li>
            <li>Make no effort to control the breath; simply breathe naturally.</li>
            <li>Focus your attention on the breath and on how the body moves with each inhalation and exhalation. Notice the movement of your body as you breathe. Observe your chest, shoulders, rib cage, and belly.</li>
            <li>Simply focus your attention on your breath without controlling its pace or intensity. If your mind wanders, return your focus back to your breath.</li>
            <li>Maintain this meditation practice for two to three minutes to start, and then try it for longer periods.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>What is meditation?</h3>
        <p>Meditation is hard to define in terms of modern-day medicine because of its many different spiritual, social, and cultural contexts. 
            Its roots also go far back: historical documents trace meditation to Hindu traditions in India as early as 1500 BCE before it spread to China in the 5thcenturies BCE.
            According to psychology.com, a lot of meditation practices share the common goal of directing attention towards one point of reference. 
            It may involve focusing on breathing, a certain object, or a phrase commonly referred to as a “mantra." 
            It also typically involves avoiding distracting thoughts about the past and future and focusing on the present moment; oftentimes, this is described as “mindfulness.” 
            One definition of meditation accepted by the medical community says it: “…refers to a family of self-regulation practice that focus on training attention and awareness in order to bring mental processes under greater voluntary control and thereby foster general mental well-being and development and/or specific capacities such as calm, clarity, and concentration” </p>
        <p>Meditation is an ancient practice that dates back thousands of years. Despite its age, this practice is common worldwide because it has benefits for brain health and overall well-being. With the help of modern technology, researchers continue to expand their understanding of how meditation helps people and why it works.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of Meditation</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Reduced Stress</li>
          <li>Emotional Balance</li>
          <li>Increased Focus</li>
          <li>Reduced Pain</li>
          <li>Reduced Anxiety</li>
          <li>Increased Creativity</li>
          <li>Reduced Depression</li>
          <li>Increased Memory</li>
          <li>Increased Compassion</li>
          <li>Increased Productivity</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Advantages of Meditation</h3>
        <p>Because meditation is most strongly associated with relaxing the mind, medical researchers are most interested in how practicing it regularly affects stress. Stress is any natural response of the human body or mind to a new demand. It allows us to keep up with new, short-term demands such as an athletic competition or looming work deadline. 
            However, prolonged stress- known as “chronic stress”- can lead to detrimental, long-term effects on the mental and physical health of individuals.
            Harmful forms of stress include routine stress, such as a long commute to work, or traumatic stress of a sudden event such as the loss of a loved one. 
            Chronic stress can negatively impact our health in the following ways: </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Elevated glucose levels</li>
            <li>Depression</li>
            <li>Weakened immunity</li>
            <li>High blood pressure</li>
            <li>Heart disease</li>
            <li>Poor attention span</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Chronic stress is associated most heavily with increased levels of a biomarker called cortisol, which InsideTracker tests for. 
            Cortisol is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenals in response to increased levels of stress.
         Our bodies need increased levels of cortisol to carry out many essential functions such as breaking down energy. 
         However, prolonged, elevated levels of cortisol in response to chronic stress can lead to depression, a repressed immune system, and degradation of body tissues, including muscle.
          Over time, this can lead to a variety of diseases and make you less productive and unhappy. 
          Clearly, we all want something that fights stress and helps manage cortisol levels...like meditation.</p>

        <h3>Concentration Meditation</h3>
        <p>Concentration meditation involves focusing on a single point. This could entail following the breath, repeating a single word or mantra, staring at a candle flame, listening to a repetitive gong, or counting beads on a mala. Since focusing the mind is challenging, a beginner might meditate for only a few minutes and then work up to longer durations.

        In this form of meditation, you simply refocus your awareness on the chosen object of attention each time you notice your mind wandering. </p>

        <h3>Mindful meditation</h3>
        <p>Mindfulness meditation encourages the practitioner to observe wandering thoughts as they drift through the mind. The intention is not to get involved with the thoughts or to judge them, but simply to be aware of each mental note as it arises.

        Through mindfulness meditation, you can see how your thoughts and feelings tend to move in particular patterns. Over time, you can become more aware of the human tendency to quickly judge an experience as good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant. With practice, an inner balance develops.</p>

        <h3>Sound Meditation</h3>
        <p>Sound bath meditation. This form uses bowls, gongs, and other instruments to create sound vibrations that help focus the mind and bring it into a more relaxed state.</p>

        <h3>Other Meditation Techniques</h3>
        <p>There are various other meditation techniques. For example, a daily meditation practice among Buddhist monks focuses directly on the cultivation of compassion. 
            This involves envisioning negative events and recasting them in a positive light by transforming them through compassion. 
            There are also moving meditation techniques, such as tai chi, qigong, and walking meditation.</p>
